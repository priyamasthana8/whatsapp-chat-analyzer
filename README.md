WhatsApp chats contain valuable information about:
- Communication habits
- User activity patterns
- Emotional tone of conversations

However, raw chat files are unstructured and difficult to analyze manually.  
This project solves that problem by converting chat data into structured insights using Python and NLP techniques.
